<h1>Anemo System's Site</h1><br>
This site is where we would update and inform our users about news and elements of our games, including <b>Dr. Octopus School</b><br>

<h2> Site Elements </h2><br>
The main page introducted our company and apresented all our projects, then there's the "Team" tab, who's intended to introduce all 
members of our team and talk about what we made, alongside some 'curiosities'.<br><br>
Then there's the "Blog" tab, where we would link to our blogspot and talk about news and updates of our projects<br>
Even if our "Blog" tab didn't worked as espected, it still works!<br><br>

<h2> Compability </h2>
We worked a lot to make the best experience to all visitors of the site, so we made it most responsive as we could!<br>
The site even has some exclusivities between different platforms! (For example: The moving logo on the computer version)<br>
<s>They aren't that different tho, just some little things</s><br><br>

<h2> Dr. Octopus School Page </h2>
'Dr. Octopus School' has his own page, wich is focused on present all elements of the game (wich are followed by images)
and explain to the viewer how those elements impacted the game! You should give it a look!<br><br>
