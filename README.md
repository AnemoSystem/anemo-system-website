<h1>Anemo System's Site</h1><br>
This site is where we would update and inform our users about news and elements of our games, including <b>Dr. Octopus School</b><br>
Even if our "Blog" tab didn't worked as espected, it still works!<br><br>

The main page introducted our company and apresented all our projects, then there's the "Team" tab, who's intended to introduce all 
members of our team and talk about what we made, alongside some 'curiosities'.<br>
'Dr. Octopus School' has his own page, wich is focused on present all elements of the game (wich are followed by images)
and explain to the viewer how those elements impacted the game! You should give it a look!<br><br>
